Assumptions/disclaimers:
	Simulation:
		Project can run fully simulated. To start simulation, toggle Main.Start from false to true. Abort and Home commands are also available.
		RFID simulates an ID of '12345'. PalletRecord[5] is simulated to have this ID so the system only updates this record when in simulation mode.
		Part/pallet presence sensors are simulated using timers in conjunction with stopper, gantry, and conveyor statuses.
	An array of moves or positions makes more sense for gantry positions but they were hardcoded to make it easier to simulate test project.  
	Each EOAT can hold 2 bars. Basis for assumption: 2 bars must be placed in a single movement from the EOAT.
	For part conveyor, a single part presence sensor detects 2 copper bars and reads false if either is not present (based on drawing in deck)
	Conveyors run on servos
	No safety code required for project
	Home positions for each of the gantries are at opposite ends of the shared linear track.
	Due to time constraints only a limited amount of fault recovery has been programmed.
	Axis speeds were set fairly slow to better observe simulation.
	Velocity, acceleration, and deceleration were hardcoded for all moves in order to maintain simplicity.

Improvements:
	Cycle time:
		Coordinated motion of axes to smooth out paths to improve motion time.
		Vary speed and acceleration of motions to minimize travel time where possible.
		Move the gantry to pre-pick position before parts arrive when possible.
		Coordinate Gantry 1 and Gantry 2 such that they can share the space over the pallet and place parts at the same time.
	Resuming operation
		Complete moves and track progress prior to unlocking doors for entry so that restart happens from a known position.
		Depending on the process, complete the entire sequence (or entire assembly) before unlocking the door.
